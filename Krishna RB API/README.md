# **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) UI**
# ** Project Overview **
This project is a **frontend user interface** designed to manage users, roles, and permissions in a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system.

The application enables administrators to:

Seamlessly view, manage, and assign roles and permissions to users.
Ensure a secure, user-friendly, and responsive environment for role and permission management.
The system is built with a focus on intuitive navigation and functionality to simplify the management of complex user roles.

Core Features
User Management
Add, edit, or remove users.
Assign roles to users and toggle their active status (Active/Inactive).
Role Management
Create, edit, or delete roles.
Assign permissions such as Read, Write, and Delete to roles.
Add custom attributes to roles to support dynamic configurations.
Permissions Management
Visualize and modify permissions easily.
Assign or adjust permissions dynamically with a clear, intuitive UI.
Mock API Simulation
Simulated API calls for all CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on users and roles.
Server responses are mocked to replicate real-time functionality, providing a smooth development experience.
Technologies Used
Frontend Framework: React
Styling: Tailwind CSS
State Management: React's useState and useReducer hooks
API Simulation: Mock API using JSON or JavaScript functions
Responsive Design: Optimized for both mobile and desktop devices
Installation and Setup
Follow the steps below to set up and run the project on your local system:

Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/krishnaxshukla/VRV-Security/edit/main/Krishna%20RB%20API
Copy code

Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd RBAC-VRV-Security-main
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the development server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The application will run in development mode. Open your browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to access the app.

How the App Works
Role Management
Click the Add Role button in the Role Management section.
Define a role (e.g., Admin, Editor, or Viewer).
Select the appropriate permissions (Read, Write, Delete) by checking the relevant options.
Save the role to make it available for assignment.
User Management
Go to the User Management section and click Add User.
Enter the user's full name and email address.
Select a role for the user from the dropdown list. (Roles must be predefined in the Role Management section.)
Mark the user's status as Active or Inactive using the checkbox.
Save the user to add them to the system.
Assigning Roles and Permissions
Roles define the actions users are allowed to perform.
Configure permissions during role creation to ensure granular control over user activities.
Usage
Once the app is set up and running, you can:

Manage Users: Add, update, or remove users from the system.
Define Roles: Create and manage roles with specific permissions.
Modify Permissions: Adjust permissions for roles as needed.
This app ensures flexibility and efficiency in managing access control for users across an organization.

Project Highlights
The UI is designed with a focus on clarity and ease of use, making it accessible to non-technical administrators.
Mock APIs simulate real-world server interactions, providing a seamless development and testing experience.
Fully responsive design ensures a consistent experience across all devices.
Future Enhancements
Here are a few potential features to consider for future development:

Integration with a backend API for real-time role and user management.
Activity Logs to track user actions and changes made in the system.
Advanced Search and Filters for quick access to specific users or roles.
Role Hierarchy Support to allow nested roles and inheritance of permissions.
Acknowledgments
This project was an invaluable learning experience. It allowed me to deepen my knowledge of React, Tailwind CSS, and user interface design.
I would like to thank the team at VRV Security for the opportunity to contribute. I look forward to expanding this project and exploring its full potential.
